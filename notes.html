<h2>Learn the positions of all of the notes on your fretboard!</h2>

<p>Play these notes once each on every string of the instrument, starting from the lowest to highest string and then back again (no skipping). This will encourage your brain to learn the note positions on all strings rather than relying on patterns or shapes. Start at 40 bpm (with a metronome), and when you can get to 80bmp you're done!</p>
