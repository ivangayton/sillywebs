<h1 id="mishima-mura-iojima-music-festival">Mishima Mura Iojima Music
Festival</h1>
<p>On September 6-11, 2022, Mishima Mura Iojima island is holding a
festival for musicians of all ages and abilities, from beginners to
world-class professionals.</p>
<p>This is not a concert festival. It is an event for people who wish to
play, learn, and grow as musicians. Guests are invited and expected to
participate, not just listen.</p>
<p>The idea is partly inspired by the musical learning philosophy of the
famous bassist Victor Wooten, who asserts that music is a language. Like
all languages, we do not learn by studying, we learn by conversing with
others. Children learning to speak do not only talk with other children,
they converse with expert language speakers (adults); in musical terms,
as beginners they are allowed to jam with professionals!</p>

<p>Iojima is a perfect location for musicians to play, interact, learn,
and grow. It is a volcanic island with a small population, a spectacular
natural setting, away from the noise and distraction of the city.
Astonishingly for such a small village, it features many comfortable
venues for music, including: - The African Djembe School, with: - Studio
A, a 7x15m performance room usually used for African drumming - Studio
B, a 7x7m rehearsal room usually used for music and dance - A large
shared kitchen - A dormitory with XX beds, showers, and laundry
facilities (usually used for the traditional annual sailing regatta, the
Mishima Cup) -A comfortable guest room - The Community Center, with: -
An XxX gymnasium with a stage at one end - The Village Center with: - An
XxX theatre room</p>
